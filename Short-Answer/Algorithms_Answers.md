#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  Being that a true or false decision is being mane of n and 'a' is not a constant if n cubed is greater than 'a' (by replacing 'a' with a + n squared if 'a' is smaller), the size of n might impact the complexity of the runtime. therefore O(n).

b)


c) recursive algorithm (calls on itself). if bunnies not 0, returns 2 + bunnies-1. one input and output at a time (with one step). therefore 0(1)
