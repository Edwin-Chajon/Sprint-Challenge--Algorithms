#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  Being that a true or false decision is being mane of n and 'a' is not a constant if n cubed is greater than 'a' (by replacing 'a' with a + n squared if 'a' is smaller), the size of n might impact the complexity of the runtime. therefore O(n).

b)


c) recursive algorithm (calls on itself). if bunnies not 0, returns 2 + bunnies-1. one input and output at a time (with one step). therefore 0(1)

## Exercise II


identify the first floor f = n[0] and start droping one egg for every single floor incrementing from the beggining. once an egg breaks, stop droping eggs and return the number of the floor in which eggs started breaking. runtime is 0(n) depending on the size of the 'n' building
